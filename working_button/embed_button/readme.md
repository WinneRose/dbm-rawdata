READ IT FIRST

Thanks for using my raw data, first I need to explain some settings
The data specified in the variables are directly dependent on the embed object, so edit it carefully while editing.
If there is an embed object that you do not want, its structure is as follows

For example, if you want to remove image, delete "image":{"url":embedimage,"height":imageheight,"width":imagewidth}" on line 81.
